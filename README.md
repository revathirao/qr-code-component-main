What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?

Initially aligning the image and text was difficult. The issue was finally resolved by applying some padding and using inline styles.

How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?

Using Bootstrap significantly reduced the amount of CSS I had to write, but I still feel more comfortable with CSS since I'm still learning Bootstrap and need to be more familiar.

In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?
For background color
